# CoffeeScript to JavaScript Baseline Model

It is some hack added to the [Seq2Seq translator model](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/master/tensorflow/models/rnn/translate) in the Tensorflow Tutorial and should be ready to use.

Best work with the [dataset generator](https://github.com/FTRobbin/coffeegen).

Feel free to ask me details questions.
